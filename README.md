# Ham Radio Digital Modes

Installs the various software packages I use for operating digital modes.

The docker-compose.yaml allows X clients to open windows on the host system X server.

Obviously the software needs access to whatever devices are connected to the radio and 
the associated audio card. Those are specified in the yaml file.

## Warning / User Beware
I'm creating this to make it easy for me to compartmentalize the software I use and to
move my ham radio operations from machine to machine. This may not be configured to work 
well for you out of the box. If you run into problems, let me know but I don't promise
to do anything about it.
